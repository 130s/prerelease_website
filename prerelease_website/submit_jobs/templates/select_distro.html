<h2>What gets tested:</h2>
<p>
Jenkins will build your package plus all released packages that have a dependency on
your package. So you will find out if your own package works, and if the release of
your package breaks any of the already released packages. Due to resource constraints
the build will only happen for one specific distribution and architecture.<br />
Jenkins will download the branches of your package that are specified in the
rosdistro file. In some cases this is trunk, in other cases this is another
branch. Check the rosdistro file to see which branches will get tested. See
<a href="http://wiki.ros.org/regression_tests">this</a> page for more details.
</p>

<h2>Why run these tests:</h2>
<p>
You should see these Jenkins tests as a powerful tool to help you to avoid the
embarrassment of releasing a broken package, or worse, from releasing a package that
breaks other people's code. While it is acceptable to release a package that does
not work on all distributions and architectures that are supported by a ROS
distribution, your package will be much more useful to the community when it works on
all supported platforms.
</p>

<h2>Reproduce test results</h2>
<p>
If you're trying to reproduce a failure that only happens on a distro/arch that
is different from your machine, you can follow <a
href="http://wiki.ros.org/regression_tests/reproducing">these
instructions</a> to set up a chroot invironment.
</p>

<h2>Problems:</h2>
<p>
If you have any problems with the pre-release tests, you can send an email with your question to ros-release at code.ros.org
