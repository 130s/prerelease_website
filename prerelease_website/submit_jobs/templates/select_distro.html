<h1>Pre-Release Tests for ROS</h1>

<h2>Select your ROS Distribution:</h2>

<h2>What gets tested:</h2>
<p>
Jenkins will build your stack plus all released stacks that have a dependency on
your stack. So you will find out if your own stack works, and if the release of
your stack breaks any of the already released stacks. The build will happen on
all the distributions and architectures that are supported by Willow Garage.
Jenkins will download the branches of your stack that are specified in the
rosdistro file. In some cases this is trunk, in other cases this is another
branch. Check the rosdistro file to see which branches will get tested. See
<a href="http://www.ros.org/wiki/regression_tests">this</a> page for more details.
</p>

<h2>Why run these tests:</h2>
<p>
You should see these Jenkins tests as a powerful tool to help you to avoid the
embarasment of releasing a broken stack, or worse, from releasing a stack that
breaks other people's code. While it is acceptable to release a stack that does
not work on all distributions and architectures that are supported by Willow
Garage, your stack will be much more useful to the community when it works on
all supported platforms.

<h2>Reproduce test results</h2>
<p>
If you're trying to reproduce a failure that only happens on a distro/arch that
is different from your machine, you can follow <a
href="http://www.ros.org/wiki/regression_tests/reproducing">these
instructions</a> to set up a chroot invironment.
</p>
